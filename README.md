This repository contains the implementation of an Enhanced SIREN model for MRI image enhancement using implicit neural representations.

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Uses **Enhanced SIREN** for MRI upscaling and enhancement.
- Applies **content-style transfer** with feature-based losses.
- Supports **low-field to high-field MRI translation**.
